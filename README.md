# MLproject-docknet
Combine different methods to separate docks from normal crops.

# Dataset description

The dataset contains roughly 7000 jpeg images. In each split(train/val/test), image are categoried into 2 classes: docks, and notdocks. Image of each class is putted into different folders, so please shuffle them before training.

It is better to have a consistent metric among different models. So I took out \~600 images from /training folder, and made a new "test" dataset. For evaluating your model, please download the newly splitted dataset.
